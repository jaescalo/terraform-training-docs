# Git Basics: Essential Skills for Your Terraform Journey

Before we dive into Terraform, let's ensure you're comfortable with Git. This version control system will be crucial for managing your infrastructure code and collaborating with others.

## 1. Creating a New Repository

Git allows you to track changes in your code over time. Let's start by creating a new repository:

1. Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in or create a new account if you don't have one. 
2. Click the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select 'New repository'.
3. Name your repository (e.g., 'terraform-training').
4. Choose 'Public' or 'Private' visibility.
5. Check 'Add a README file'.
6. Click 'Create repository'.

## 2. Setting Up SSH Keys

> Note: If you are a Windows user, make sure to run the commands below in PowerShell, rather the Cmd Prompt. You do not need "Run as Administrator" unless specified

SSH keys provide a secure way to connect with GitHub:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Generate a new SSH key:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/terraformclub
    ```
    At the "Enter passphrase" prompt you can leave it empty for no passphase.
3. Add the keys to the ssh-agent:

    ### _MacOS_
    - Start the ssh-agent:
    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ```

    - Check to see if your ~/.ssh/config file exists in the default location.
    ```bash
    open ~/.ssh/config
    ```
    If the file doesn't exist, create the file.
    ```bash
    touch ~/.ssh/config
    ```

    - Open your `~/.ssh/config` file, then modify the file to contain the following lines. 

    ```text
    Host github.com
        AddKeysToAgent yes
        UseKeychain yes
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/terraformclub
    ```

    ### _Windows_
    - Right-click Start Menu, select "Windows Powershell (Admin)"
    ```powershell
    Set-Service -Name ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic
    Start-Service -Name ssh-agent
    ```
4. Add your SSH key to the agent:
    ```bash
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/terraformclub
5. Copy your public key:
    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/terraformclub.pub
6. Go to GitHub Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key.
7. Paste your key and save.

## 3. Cloning Your Repository
Now, let's get your repository on your local machine. Assuming your repository name is `terraform-training`:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/terraform-training.git
cd terraform-training
```

## 4. Making Changes and Committing
As you work on your Terraform configurations, you'll need to commit your changes:

1. Make some changes to your files.
2. Stage your changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
3. Commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add initial Terraform configuration"

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Write clear, concise commit messages to document your work effectively.

## 5. Pushing Your Changes
Finally, let's push your local commits to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've mastered the Git basics needed for this course. Remember to commit and push your work regularly. In the next section, we'll start exploring Terraform fundamentals.

**Exercise:** Create a new repository for your Terraform projects, set up SSH, clone it locally, make a small change to the README, commit, and push. This will ensure you're ready for the journey ahead!
