# Generating Akamai API Credentials

Before we can use Terraform with Akamai, we need to set up API credentials. These credentials will allow Terraform to interact with Akamai's Property Manager and Security services.

## Steps to Create Akamai API Credentials

1. Log in to the [Akamai Control Center](https://control.akamai.com/).
2. Navigate to "Identity & Access" → "API Users & Keys".
3. Click on "Create API Client".
4. Fill in the form:
   - Name: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "Terraform-Akamai")
   - Description: Briefly describe the purpose (e.g., "API client for Terraform automation")
   - API Service: Select "Property Manager API (PAPI)" and "Security API"
   - Access Level: Choose "READ-WRITE" for both APIs
5. Click "Create Client".

**Important:** After creation, you'll see the client secret and other credentials. Download or copy these immediately—you won't be able to access the client secret again.

## Understanding Your Akamai API Credentials

You'll receive four pieces of information:

1. Client Token
2. Client Secret
3. Access Token
4. Base URL

All of these are required to authenticate your API requests to Akamai.

## Using Akamai Credentials with Terraform

When you're working with more than one account, move between them using an account switch key with an API client enabled to manage multiple accounts. If you're not working with more than one account disregard the `AKAMAI_ACCOUNT_KEY` and `account_key` below.

To use these credentials with Terraform, you can set them as environment variables:

```bash
export AKAMAI_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
export AKAMAI_HOST="your_base_url"
export AKAMAI_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"
export AKAMAI_CLIENT_TOKEN="your_client_token"
export AKAMAI_ACCOUNT_KEY="your_account_id"
```

Alternatively, you can use an **_.edgerc_** file, which is a common way to store Akamai credentials:

1. Create a file named **_.edgerc_** in your home directory.
2. Add the following content:

```text filename=".edgerc" copy
[default]
client_secret = your_client_secret
host = your_base_url
access_token = your_access_token
client_token = your_client_token
account_key = you_account_id
```
The **_.edgerc_** method will be used for the examples and exercises in this course.

## Best Practices for Akamai API Credential Security

1. Never share your API credentials or commit them to your Git repository.
2. Use environment variables or the **_.edgerc_** file to manage your credentials securely.
3. Regularly rotate your API credentials, especially if you suspect they might have been compromised.
4. Only grant the necessary permissions to your API client.

## Next Steps

With your Akamai API credentials set up, you're ready to start using Terraform to manage Akamai resources. In the next section, we'll begin configuring Terraform to work with Akamai Property Manager and Security services.
