# Generating Your Linode API Key

Before we start using Terraform with Linode, we need to generate an API key. This key will allow Terraform to create and manage resources in your Linode account.

## Steps to Create Your API Key

1. Log in to your [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/).
2. Click on your username at the top right, then select "API Tokens".
3. Click the "Create a Personal Access Token" button.
4. In the "Label" field, enter a name for your token (e.g., "Terraform Access").
5. For expiry, you can choose "Never" if you want a permanent token, or set a specific duration.
6. Under "Public Access", select "None".
7. In the "Access" section, ensure the following permissions are enabled:
   - Linodes: Read/Write
   - Volumes: Read/Write
   - IPs: Read/Write
   - Stackscripts: Read/Write
   - Images: Read/Write
   - Events: Read Only
   - Account: Read Only
8. Click "Create Token".

> ⚠️ **Important:** Your full API key will be displayed only once. Make sure to copy it and store it securely. You'll need this key when configuring Terraform to work with Linode.

## Using Your API Key with Terraform

To use this API key with Terraform, you'll typically set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export LINODE_TOKEN="your_api_token_here"
```

## Best Practices for API Key Security

1. Never share your API key or commit it to your Git repository.
2. Use environment variables or secure secret management tools to handle your API key.
3. Regularly rotate your API keys, especially if you suspect they might have been compromised.
4. Only grant the minimum necessary permissions to your API key.

## Next Steps
Now that you have your Linode API key, you're ready to start using Terraform with Linode. In the next section, we'll begin setting up our Terraform configuration files.

**Exercise:** Generate your Linode API key following the steps above. Practice setting it as an environment variable in your terminal. Verify that you can access your Linode account programmatically using this key.
