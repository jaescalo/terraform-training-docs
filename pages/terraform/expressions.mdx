# Expressions

Expressions refer to or compute values within a configuration. The simplest expressions are just literal values, like "hello" or 5, but the Terraform language also allows more complex expressions such as references to data exported by resources, arithmetic, conditional evaluation, and a number of built-in functions. 

In the next sections we'll cover some of the most common expressions, hwoever for an extended read check the [official documentation here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions).
