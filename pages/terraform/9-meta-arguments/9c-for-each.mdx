# The for_each Meta-Argument

The `for_each` meta-argument accepts a map or a set of strings, and creates an instance for each item in that map or set. Each instance has a distinct infrastructure object associated with it, and each is separately created, updated, or destroyed when the configuration is applied.

## Example
In this case, the for_each meta-argument is used to create multiple DNS records based on a map of DNS records defined in the dns_records variable.

```hcl filename="variables.tf" copy
variable "dns_records" {
  default = {
    "record1" = {
      recordType = "A"
      ttl        = 60
      target     = "172.233.190.92"
      name       = "origin.example.com"
    },
    "record2" = {
      recordType = "MX"
      ttl        = 60
      target     = "10 email.example.com"
      name       = "example.com"
    }
  }
}
```
The above is a map of objects, in other words a list of "JSON-like" objects. This structure allows to add more information for each DNS record such as the `recordType`, `ttl`, `target` and `name`. With the help of `for_each` all thees values can be used of each resource instance.

```hcl filename="main.tf" copy {2,5-8}
resource "akamai_dns_record" "tf_demo_dns_records" {
  for_each = var.dns_records

  zone       = "example.com"
  recordtype = each.value.recordType
  ttl        = each.value.ttl
  target     = [each.value.target]
  name       = each.value.name
}
```

`for_each = var.additional_records` tells Terraform to create one `akamai_dns_record` resource per element in the `dns_records` map.

Inside the resource block, you can access the current map element's key using `each.key` (e.g., "record1") and the value using `each.value` (which is another map with recordType, ttl, target, and name properties).

Using `each.key` to refer to the instances created by `for_each`:
```hcl
akamai_dns_record.my_dns_hostnames["record1"]
akamai_dns_record.my_dns_hostnames["record2"]
```

Using `each.value` to populate the resource attributes
```hcl
recordtype = each.value.recordType
ttl = each.value.ttl
target = [each.value.target]
name = each.value.name
```

So, in this example, the `for_each` will create a single `akamai_dns_record` resource with the values from the "record1" and "record2" elements of the `dns_records` map.

The key benefit of using for_each in this case is the ability to easily add or remove DNS records by updating the `dns_records` variable, without having to modify the resource configuration itself.

## `for_each` vs. `count`

The main difference between `count` and `for_each` in Terraform is the way they handle iteration and resource identification.

### `count`

* Allows you to create multiple instances of a resource based on a numerical value.
* The resources are identified by their numerical index, e.g. `akamai_dns_record.my_dns_hostnames[0]`, `akamai_dns_record.my_dns_hostnames[1]`.
* You cannot use `count` and `for_each` on the same resource block.

### `for_each`

* Allows you to create multiple instances of a resource based on a map or set of strings.
* The resources are identified by the map keys or set elements, e.g. `akamai_dns_record.my_dns_hostnames["record1"]`, `akamai_dns_record.my_dns_hostnames["record2"]`.
* You cannot use a numerical list with for_each.
