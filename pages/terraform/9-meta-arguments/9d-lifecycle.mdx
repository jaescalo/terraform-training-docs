# The lifecycle Meta-Argument

`lifecycle` is a block that has arguments which allow you to control how Terraform manages resources throughout their lifecycle.

### `create_before_destroy`

```hcl filename="main.tf" copy {5}
resource "akamai_edgeworker" "my_edgeworker" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

* When set to `true`, Terraform creates the new resource before destroying the old one
* Useful for zero-downtime deployments

### `prevent_destroy`

```hcl filename="main.tf" copy {5}
resource "akamai_datastream" "my_datastream" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

* Prevents the resource from being destroyed
* Will cause an error if you try to destroy the resource

### `replace_triggered_by`

```hcl filename="main.tf" copy {5}
resource "akamai_cloudaccess_key" "my_access_key" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  lifecycle {
    replace_triggered_by = [
        akamai_property.my_property.latest_version
    ]
  }
}
```

* Forces replacement of the resource when specified attributes of other resources change
* Useful for dependencies that require recreation of resources

### `ignore_changes`
The most common use case for `ignore_changes` on Akamai is for arguments that may change frequently.
For example, in a GitOps operation the `note` argument in the `akamai_property_activation` might contain things like commit IDs, timestamps, or other values that change frequently.

```hcl filename="main.tf" copy {5}
resource "akamai_property_activation" "my_activation" {
    property_id                    = "prp_12345"
    network                        = "staging"
    contact                        = ["jsmith@example.com"]
    note                           = var.activation_notes
    version                        = "1"
    auto_acknowledge_rule_warnings = true

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
        note
    ]
  }
}
```

* Without ignore_changes, every time the note changes, Terraform would try to create a new activation
* By ignoring changes to note, Terraform won't trigger a new activation just because the note changed
* This prevents unnecessary activations while still maintaining the desired state of other important configuration

## Exercises

1. Add lifecyle `ignore_changes` to both of the 2 `akamai_property_activation` resources in your property.tf to prevent changes to the notes to trigger activations. 
2. Run terraform
3. Make a change to the `note` argument and run Terraform again. What happens?
4. Commit your change and push it to GitHub.
