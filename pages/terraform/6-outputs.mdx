# 6. Outputs

Outputs are a way to print data to the shell after a Terraform run, or to pass data between modules. They are often used to show values to the user which would otherwise be hidden as part of troubleshooting.

## Syntax

In its simplest form, and output looks like this

```hcl
output "property id" {
    value = akamai_property.my_property.id
}
```

Here, the value is inferred from a resource (which is the norm), but if you wish the value could simply be a string, or a combination of both.

Outputs can also contain the keywords `description` and `sensitive`. A `description` is purely to help the reader understand the purpose of the output, by `sensitive` can be used to suppress values from the output of `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`.

```hcl
output "property id" {
    value = akamai_property.my_property.id
    description = "The ID of my property"
    sensitive = true
}
```

## Exercises

1. Create a terraform file called outputs.tf
2. Create outputs with the IDs for all 3 data sources created in the Exercises section in module [4. Data Sources](/terraform/4-data-sources#exercises)
3. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
