# 13. Import to Terraform

Terraform import allows you to bring existing infrastructure resources under Terraform management. Here's how it works:

1. First, you write a resource configuration block in your Terraform code that matches the resource you want to import.

2. Then you use the `terraform import` command with the syntax:

```shell copy
terraform import [resource_type].[resource_instance] [resource_id]
```
The `resource_id`is resource-specific. You can find the required ID in the provider documentation for the resource you wish to import.

3. Terraform will:
    * Find the existing resource
    * Add it to your state file
    * Allow you to manage it going forward with Terraform

## Example
Let's assume we have a Cloudlet policy deployed and we want to manage it in Terraform going forward. The first step is to add the resource to the Terraform code:

```hcl filename="main.tf" copy {}
resource "akamai_cloudlets_policy" "policy" {
  name          = "my_cloudlet_policy"
  cloudlet_code = "ER"
  description   = "Marketing"
  group_id      = "12345"
  match_rules   = data.akamai_cloudlets_edge_redirector_match_rule.match_rules_er_default.json
  is_shared     = true
}
```
Observe the `data` source type for the `match_rules` argument must also exist because it is a dependency for the `akamai_cloudlets_policy` resource. We'll skip it for now but you can check the [Cloudlets subprovider](https://techdocs.akamai.com/terraform/docs/cl-ds-edge-redirector-match-rule) for more information.

Once the resource has been defined in the main.tf file we can proceed with the import:
```shell copy
terraform import akamai_cloudlets_policy.policy my_cloudlet_policy
```

In this particular case the Cloudlet ID matches with the `name` argument in the resource definition. However, this may not always be the case. See the following import commands for other various resources:

```shell copy
# EdegeDNS
terraform import akamai_dns_zone.my_zone ZONE_NAME

#AppSec
terraform import akamai_appsec_configuration.my_config CONFIG_ID

# EdgeKV
terraform import akamai_edgekv.my_edgekv NAMESPACE:NETWORK

# CP Code
terraform import akamai_cp_code.my_cp_code CP_CDOE_ID,CONTRACT_ID,GROUP_ID

# Property
terraform import akamai_property.my_property PROPERTY_ID,CONTRACT_ID,GROUP_ID,PROPERTY_VERSION
```

## Akamai CLI
What if there was a tool that did all this for you for Akamai resources. Well, there is!
The [Akamai CLI for Akamai Terraform Provider](https://github.com/akamai/cli-terraform) can convert Akamai resources to Terraform resources and provide you with all the import commands to create the initial stage file.
