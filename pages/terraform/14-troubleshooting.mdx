# 14. Troubleshooting

## Logging
For debugging you can enable the logging level: `OFF`, `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN` or `ERROR`. `TRACE` will give the Akamai outputs.

```shell copy
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
```

Additionally you can set the path of the log with the TF_LOG_PATH variable:

```shell copy
export TF_LOG_PATH=./akamai_tf.log
```

If you are experiencing Akamai API-like errors you can turn on the API calls logging. Make sure TF_LOG is set to DEBUG, and then:
```shell copy
export AKAMAI_HTTP_TRACE_ENABLED=true
```

## Akamai Provider Code
Sometimes when the documentation is not enough you may need to dig into [Akamai provider's code](https://github.com/akamai/terraform-provider-akamai).
