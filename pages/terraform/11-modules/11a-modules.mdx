# Modules

Terraform modules are reusable, self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that encapsulate a set of resources with a specific purpose. A module consists of a collection of _.tf_ files kept together in a directory (commonly under ./modules/). 

**The Root Module**

Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as its root module, which consists of the resources defined in the .tf files in the main working directory. For instance:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="terraform-project" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="main.tf" />
    <FileTree.File name="outputs.tf" />
    <FileTree.File name="providers.tf" />
    <FileTree.File name="variables.tf" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

**Child Modules**

A Terraform module (usually the root module of a configuration) can call other modules to include their resources into the configuration. A module that has been called by another module is often referred to as a child module, but in the day to day work you'll hear them referred as just "modules". 

Child modules can be called multiple times within the same configuration, and multiple configurations can use the same module. The recommended convention is to store all your children modules in a directory named ./modules/. For example you have created a module for creating CPS (Certificate Provisioning System) enrollments:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="terraform-project" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="main.tf" />
    <FileTree.File name="outputs.tf" />
    <FileTree.File name="providers.tf" />
    <FileTree.File name="variables.tf" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="modules" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="cps" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="main.tf" />
        <FileTree.File name="outputs.tf" />
        <FileTree.File name="providers.tf" />
        <FileTree.File name="variables.tf" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

If you also noted from the above structure, the **_providers.tf_** may also need to be defined at the child module level. Although any parameters for the provider will be passed by the root module so no need to re-define all the provider parameters.

It may not come by surprise at this point that the Terraform code you've created (root module) so far can be used as a child module with little or no changes at all.

## Calling a Child Module
Modules are called from within other modules using `module` blocks:
```hcl filename="main.tf" {2}
module "cert_enrollment" {
  source = "./modules/cps"  # Path to module
  
  # Input variables
  contract   = "C-0N7R4C7"
  common_name = "www.example.com"
}
```

**Key Components:**
* The label immediately after the `module` keyword is a local name (`cert_enrollment` in above's example), which the calling module can use to refer to this instance of the module.
* Source: Where the module code lives (local path in this case but it could also be a Git repo or Terraform Registry)
* Input Variables: Parameters you can pass to customize the module. These parameters must exist as variables in the child module.
* Resources: The `my-module` contains the resources.
