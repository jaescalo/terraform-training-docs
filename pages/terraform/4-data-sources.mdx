# 4. Data Source

Data sources are intended for infrastructure which already exists. As such, they are not created, updated or destroyed by Terraform, but rather simply referenced. Think of them as read-only.

## Syntax

Data sources are declared similarly to resources, but use the `data` keyword. Like this:

```hcl
data "data_source_type" "data_source_instance" {
    # ... configuration options ...
}
```

They `data_source_type` comes from your provider and `data_source_instance` is the name or label you use for the _instance_ and must be unique.

For example:
```hcl /data/ filename="main.tf" copy
data "akamai_group" "my_group" {
     group_name   = "My Group"
     contract_id  = "1-2AB34C"
}
```

Here, we are looking for the `akamai_group` named "My Group", which can be found in the given contract. This is useful as we may wish to use the group ID but only know its name. 

# Referencing Data Sources

References to data source IDs always start with `data`, and then the type and instance names separated by `.`. The format is as follows:

```hcl /data./
data.<data source type>.<data source instance>.<instance attribute>
```

For example:

```hcl /data./ filename="main.tf" copy {2}
resource "akamai_property" "example" {
    group_id    = data.akamai_group.my_group.id
    # ... other configuration ...
}
```

Here we cross-reference the `id` attribute of the `my_group` instance of the `akamai_group` data source, in order to use it in our `akamai_property` resource. References can be used in different types of Terraform blocks such as [modules](/terraform/modules) and [outputs](/terraform/outputs).
