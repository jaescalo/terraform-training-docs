# `for` Expressions

A `for` expression in Terraform is like a loop that helps you transform or process lists and maps of data. Think of it as a way to say "for each item in this collection, do something with it". For more information about `for` expression [check here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/for) 

Here are some common use cases with simple examples:

## Creating a new list from an existing list
Convert a list of domains into edge hostnames.
```hcl filename="main.tf" copy {7}
variable "domains" {
  default = ["example.com", "api.example.com"]
}

locals {
  edge_hostnames = [for domain in var.domains : "${domain}.edgesuite.net"]
  # Result: [
  #   "example.com.edgesuite.net",
  #   "api.example.com.edgesuite.net"
  # ]
} 
```

## Creating a map from a list
Converting a list of hostnames into a map containing the respective edge hostnames.
```hcl filename="main.tf" copy {3}
locals {
  edge_hostnames = {for domain in var.domains : "${domain}" => "${domain}.edgesuite.net"}
  # Result: {
  #   "api.example.com" = "api.example.com.edgesuite.net"
  #   "example.com"     = "example.com.edgesuite.net"
  # }
}
```

## Filtering items
Filter out the example.com domain from the list.
```hcl filename="main.tf" copy {7}
variable "all_names" {
  default = ["example.com", "api.example.com", "www.example.com"]
}

locals {
  hostnames = [for item in var.all_names : item if item != "example.com"]
}

output "hostname" {
  value = local.hostnames
}
# Result: [
#   "api.example.com",
#   "www.example.com"
# ]
```

The main benefits of `for` expressions are:

- They help you avoid repetitive code
- They make it easier to process lists and maps
- They allow you to transform data into the format you need
- They're great for creating multiple similar resources
