# Terraform Core Workflow

The core Terraform workflow consists of three main steps after you have written your Terraform configuration:

| Command         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. `init`       | Initialize prepares your project so Terraform can apply your configuration. When you initialize, Terraform configures the backend, installs all providers and modules referred to in your configuration, and creates a version lock file if one doesn't already exist.                                                    |
| 2. `plan`     | Plan allows you to preview the changes Terraform will make before you apply them. creates a plan consisting of a set of changes that will make your resources match your configuration. Terraform plan does not make any changes to your resources, you must apply a plan for Terraform to make changes. |
| 3. `apply` | Terraform uses the providers and modules installed during initialization to execute the steps stored in an execution plan. These steps create, update, and delete infrastructure to match your resource configuration.                                                |

You will run the above workflow multiple times during this workshop. Pay close attention to the `terraform plan` output.
