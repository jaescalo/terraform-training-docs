# Resources

Resources are the most important element in Terraform, and represent all the pieces of infrastructure you are managing within Terraform. Every resource is declared in the format:

```terraform
resource "resource_type" "resource_instance" {
    # Config options here
}
```

`resource_type` comes from your provider, e.g. `akamai_property`, and can (and likely will) be reused many times. However, `resource_instance` is the name you use for the _instance_ of your resource type and as such must be unique. For example, a pair of property resources might look like this:

```terraform
resource "akamai_property" "my-property" {
    name        = "my-property"
    product_id  = "prd_product"
    contract_id = "ctr_C-0N7RAC7"
    group_id    = "grp_12345"
    rule_format = "v2023-01-05"
}

resource "akamai_property" "my-other-property" {
    name        = "my-other-property"
    product_id  = "prd_product"
    contract_id = "ctr_C-0N7RAC7"
    group_id    = "grp_12345"
    rule_format = "v2023-01-05"
}
```

Your terraform files will likely be largely made up of resources, which can be often different types but it is common to have multiple instances of the same type.

## Referencing Resources

When you create a resource in terraform it is common to need to reference some aspect of that resource. This is done in the following format:

```terraform
<resource type>.<instance label>.<instance attribute>
```

For example, if you were configuring a property resource and wanted to refer to the name of an edgehostname you had created above, you could do it like this:

```terraform
resource "akamai_edge_hostname" "ehn" {
  product_id    = "prd_Fresca"
  contract_id   = data.akamai_contract.contract.id
  group_id      = data.akamai_group.group.id
  ip_behavior   = "IPV4"
  edge_hostname = "www.example.com.edgesuite.net"
}

resource "akamai_property" "property" {
  name        = "property"
  ...
  hostnames {
    cname_from             = "www.example.com"
    cname_to               = akamai_edge_hostname.ehn.edge_hostname
    cert_provisioning_type = "CPS_MANAGED"
  }
}
```

Here, we reference our instance of the `akamai_edge_hostname` resource type whose label is `ehn`. Then from that object we use the `edge_hostname` attribute, and as such the whole reference becomes `akamai_edge_hostname.ehn.edge_hostname`

## Exercises

1. Create a terraform file named `security.tf` with an `akamai_appsec_configuration` resource and an `akamai_appsec_security_policy` resource
2. Configure the `akamai_appsec_security_policy` resource to get its `config_id` from the `akamai_appsec_configuration`
3. Duplicate the two resources above and change the names, in order to create 2 config/policy pairs.
