# 11. Modules

Terraform modules are reusable, self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that encapsulate a set of resources with a specific purpose. A module consists of a collection of _.tf_ files kept together in a directory (commonly under ./modules/). 

**The Root Module**

Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as its root module, which consists of the resources defined in the .tf files in the main working directory.

**Child Modules**

A Terraform module (usually the root module of a configuration) can call other modules to include their resources into the configuration. A module that has been called by another module is often referred to as a child module, but in the day to day work you'll hear them referred as just "modules". 

Child modules can be called multiple times within the same configuration, and multiple configurations can use the same module. The recommended convention is to store all your children modules in a directory named ./modules/. For example you have created a module for creating CPS (Certificate Provisioning System) enrollments:

```text {6-7}
# Basic module structure
terraform-project/
  ├── main.tf         # Main configuration file
  ├── variables.tf    # Input variables
  ├── outputs.tf      # Output values
  ├── providers.tf    # Providers configurations
  └── modules/        # Directory for your modules
      └── cps/
          ├── main.tf
          ├── variables.tf
          ├── providers.tf
          └── outputs.tf
```

If you also noted from the above structure, the providers.tf may also need to be defined at the child module level. Although any parameters for the provider will be passed by the root module so no need to re-define all the provider parameters.

It may not come by surprise at this point that the Terraform code you've created (root module) so far can be used as a child module with little or no changes at all.

## Calling a Child Module
Modules are called from within other modules using `module` blocks:
```hcl filename="main.tf" {2}
module "cert_enrollment" {
  source = "./modules/cps"  # Path to module
  
  # Input variables
  contract   = "C-0N7R4C7"
  common_name = "www.example.com"
}
```

**Key Components:**
* The label immediately after the `module` keyword is a local name (cert_enrollment in above's example), which the calling module can use to refer to this instance of the module.
* Source: Where the module code lives (local path in this case but it could also be a Git repo or Terraform Registry)
* Input Variables: Parameters you can pass to customize the module. These parameters must exist as variables in the child module.
* Resources: The `my-module` contains the resources.

## Passing values from Child Module
The resources defined in a module are encapsulated, so the calling module cannot access their attributes directly. However, the child module can declare output values to selectively export certain values to be accessed by the calling module.   

```hcl filename="./modules/cps/variables.tf" copy
variable "contract" {}
variable "common_name" {}
```

```hcl filename="./modules/cps/main.tf" copy {}
resource "akamai_cps_dv_enrollment" "my_enrollment" {
  contract_id = var.contract
  common_name = var.common_name
  # ... other configuration ...
}
```

```hcl filename="./modules/cps/outputs.tf" copy {}
output "dns_challenges" {
  value = akamai_cps_dv_enrollment.my_enrollment.dns_challenges
}

output "enrollment_id" {
  value = akamai_cps_dv_enrollment.my_enrollment.id
}
```

The outputs are values that the module returns for other parts of your code to use. In the example above the certificate enrollment ID can be used in the `akamai_edge_hostname` resource, and the DNS Challenges for the certificate domain validation can be used to update Edge DNS records in a different module:

```hcl filename="main.tf" copy {14,20}
module "cert_enrollment" {
  source = "./modules/cps"  # Path to module
  contract   = "C-0N7RAC7"
  common_name = "www.example.com"
  # ... other configuration ...
}

resource "akamai_edge_hostname" "my_edge_hostname" {
  product_id    = "Fresca"
  contract_id   = "C-0N7RAC7"
  group_id      = "12345"
  ip_behavior   = "IPV4"
  edge_hostname = "example.com.edgekey.net"
  certificate   = module.cert_enrollment.enrollment_id
}

module "akamai_edgedns" {
  source                = "./modules/dns"
  dns_zone              = "example.com"
  challenge_records     = module.cert_enrollment.dns_challenges
}
```

## Exercise \#1
1. Create a new directory named modules, and inside it a sub-directory named edgeworkers. So you end up with ./modules/edgeworkers
2. In your ./modules/edgeworkers create all the necessary *.tf files to create a new EdgeWorker ID. Make sure that the `name`, `group_id` and `resource_tier_id` are parameters that can be set by the root module.
3. Back in your root directory create a new edgeworkers.tf file and add the necessary Terraform code to call the EdgeWorkers module. 
4. Run Terraform. Why do you need to run a `terraform init`?
5. After running the `terraform init` try to run Terraform again. What happened? _Hint_: remember to define the `akamai` provider in the child modules.
6. Run Terraform again. 
7. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub. 

## Exercise \#2
1. In your property.tf you should have the rule tree defined in a `data.akamai_property_rules_builder`. Convert this data source to a Terraform module instead. 
  - Create a new directory inside the modules directory and name it rules. So ./modules/rules
  - Add all the necessary child module *.tf files inside this directory.

_Hint_: remember to create the variables.tf with any of the parameters needed for your rule tree. If you've been following along you should have 2 parameters in the rule tree: `ab_test` for the origin selection and the `akamai_cp_code.my_cp_code.id`. These 2 values will be arguments when you call the module. 

2. Use your new child module in you property.tf to build the rule tree and update the `akamai_property` accordingly.

_Hint_: remember that the `akamai_property` resource requires the `rule_format` and `rules` argument which should be updated with the expression to reference the newly created module. Also keep in mind that you need to define these values as outputs in the child module.

3. Run Terraform 
4. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
