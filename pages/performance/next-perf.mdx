# Built In Features

Next supports multiple features that can be controlled by the developer and can also be used as ideas to help us when consulting our customers.

## Components

Next has built in components to optimize things like script loading, image loading and optimization (incuding an [Akamai Image Manager](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/images#akamai) integration), font loading, and a link component to handle prefetching and client side navigation.
