# Introduction

Next.js is a full-stack [React](https://react.dev/learn) Single Page Application framework. It’s versatile and lets you create React apps of any size—from a mostly static blog to a complex dynamic application. To create a new Next.js project, run in your terminal:

```bash filename="Terminal" {3} copy
npx create-next-app@latest
```

[Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) is maintained by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). You can deploy a Next.js app to any Node.js or serverless hosting, or to your own server. Next.js also supports a static export which doesn’t require a server.
