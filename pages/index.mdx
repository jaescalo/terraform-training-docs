# Introduction

This Terraform training will provide a comprehensive overview of infrastructure as code using Terraform, with a focus on the Akamai provider. We'll start by covering the fundamental Terraform concepts - from expressions and resources to meta-arguments and modules. This solid Terraform foundation will enable you to then dive into Akamai-specific use cases (and any other provider out there), leveraging Terraform's advanced features like meta-arguments and functions to automate the deployment and configuration of Akamai products such as properties, domains, and certificates. By the end of the training, you'll have the skills, foundations and practical experience needed to implement efficient, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure as code using Terraform.

## What is Terraform?

[HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.

With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations. It also ensures that you provision the same environment every time.
