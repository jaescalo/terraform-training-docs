# Introduction

By the end of this workshop a new application will be onboarded to Akamai by leveraging only Terraform.
* A [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) (Akamai Edge Compute) will be setup to serve as the origin
* A new configuration in Property Manager

## What is Terraform?

[HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.

With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations. It also ensures that you provision the same environment every time.
