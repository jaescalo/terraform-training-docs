This is an optional but highly encourage exercise. If you don't have access to Linode Object Storage you can configure any other compatible remote backend.

1. In Linode setup an Object Storage (S3) bucket to store the state file. 
2. If you don't have the necessary access credentials follow the instructions in the [Linode API Requirements](/requirements/linode-api) section. 
3. Configure Terraform to store the state file in the remote backend.
4. Run Terraform 
5. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
