This is an optional but highly encourage exercise. If you don't have access to Linode Object Storage you can configure any other compatible remote backend.

<Steps>
{<h3>New S3 Bucket</h3>}
In Linode setup an Object Storage (S3) bucket to store the state file. 

{<h3>API Access</h3>}
If you don't have the necessary access credentials follow the instructions in the [Linode API Requirements](/requirements/linode-api) section. 

{<h3>Configure</h3>}
Configure Terraform to store the state file in the remote backend.

{<h3>Init</h3>}
Run `terraform init --reconfigure` to apply the new backend configuration.

{<h3>Commit</h3>}
Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
