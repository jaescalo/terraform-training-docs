<Steps>
{<h3>New File</h3>}
Create a file named **_provider.tf_** in your local clone of your GitHub repository. Populate it as the example above.

{<h3>Update</h3>}
Update the Akamai required version to use the `~>` operator, and specify only the Major and Minor versions, e.g. 1.1, rather than 1.1.0. This means that Terraform will install any minor updates when running `init`, but not the next major version. Make sure Terraform uses the most recent version.

{<h3>Run</h3>}
Run `terraform init`. Which version was installed?

{<h3>Commit</h3>}
Commit your change and push it to GitHub.
