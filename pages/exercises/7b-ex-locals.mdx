<Steps>
{<h3>Configure</h3>}
In your **_main.tf_** create a local named `notes` which could be referenced in different resources later on (e.g. `akamai_appsec_activations`, `akamai_property`).

{<h3>Update</h3>}
The `notes` local is a joined string containing a ficticious ticket ID (e.g. TF-3001) and the group ID.

{<h3>Validate</h3>}
Run `terraform validate` to confirm you don't have any sytax errors or missing statements in the code. You could run `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` too, but because we are not modifying any resources no changes will be detected/applied anyway.

{<h3>Commit</h3>}
Commit your change and push it to GitHub.
