{<h3>New File</h3>}
Create a new **_gtm.tf_** file and add the `akamai_gtm_domain` resource with all the necessary parameters for the domain you want to import. 

{<h3>Plan</h3>}
Run a `terraform plan`. Is Terraform going to add a new GTM domain or reuse the existing one at this point?

{<h3>State</h3>}
Run a `terraform state list` and look for the `akamai_gtm_domain` resource. Did you find it? Why not?

{<h3>Import</h3>}
Import the GTM domain into Terraform's state file. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
_Hint_: refer to the `akamai_gtm_domain` resource documentation in [Techdocs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/terraform/docs/gtm-rc-domain). You could also use the Akamai CLI to export a GTM domain.
</Callout>

{<h3>Check the State</h3>}
Run a `terraform state list` command to verify the new resource has been succeessfuly imported to the state file.

{<h3>Plan</h3>}
Run another `terraform plan`. What happens now?

{<h3>Commit</h3>}
Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
