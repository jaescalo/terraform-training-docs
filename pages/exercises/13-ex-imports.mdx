1. Create a new gtm.tf file and add the `akamai_gtm_domain` resource with all the necessary parameters for the domain you want to import. 
2. Run a `terraform plan`. Is Terraform going to add a new GTM domain or reuse the existing one at this point?
3. Run a `terraform state list` and look for the `akamai_gtm_domain` resource. Did you find it? Why not?
4. Import the GTM domain into Terraform's state file. **_Hint_**: refer to the `akamai_gtm_domain` resource documentation in [Techdocs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/terraform/docs/gtm-rc-domain). You could also use the Akamai CLI to export a GTM domain.
5. Run a `terraform state list` command to verify the new resource has been succeessfuly imported to the state file.
6. Run another `terraform plan`. What happens now?
7. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
