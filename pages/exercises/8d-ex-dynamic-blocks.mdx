- At this point you should have a **_property.tf_** file that creates a property with a single hostname. If not review the Exercise #2 in module [5. Resources](/terraform/5-resources#exercise-2).

- You should also have a list of hostnames in a local variable named `apps_hostnames` from the previous exercise in module [For Expressions](/terraform/8c-for-loops#exercises).

<Steps>
{<h3>Configure</h3>}
Add a `dynamic` block in the `akamai_property` resource to add all the hostnames in the `apps_hostnames` list to the property. The hostnames can share the same edge hostname and other required parameters.

{<h3>Plan/Apply</h3>}
Run `terraform plan` to confirm your changes. Run `terraform apply` if all looks in order.

{<h3>Commit</h3>}
Commit your change and push it to GitHub.
