<Steps>
{<h3>New File</h3>}
Create a **_variables.tf_** file which declares the variables `edgerc_path` and `config_section`, both of type `string`. Configure these with descriptions and default values.

{<h3>Update</h3>}
Update your **_provider.tf_** file to use these variables in the `provider "akamai"` block.

{<h3>Init</h3>}
Run `terraform init` and confirm the provider is installed correctly.

{<h3>Plan</h3>}
Run `terraform plan`, providing new values for the 2 variables using the `-var` syntax. You could run `terraform apply` too, but because we are not modifying any resources no changes will be applied anyway.

{<h3>New File</h3>}
Create a **_terraform.tfvars_** file and use it to set new values for both variables. 

{<h3>Plan</h3>}
Re-run `terraform plan` using this file instead. You could run `terraform apply` too, but because we are not modifying any resources no changes will be applied anyway.

{<h3>Commit</h3>}
Commit your changes and push them to GitHub. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
_Hint_: If you use **_terraform.tfvars_** you don't need to tell Terraform the variable file's name. If you use anything else (**_.tfvars_**) you must use `-var-file`
