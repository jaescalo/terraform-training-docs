<Steps>
{<h3>Update</h3>}
Add 2 `akamai_property_activation` resources to your **_property.tf_**. One for the staging network and the other one for the production network. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
_Hint_: You can use the `local.notes` defined in the Exercises section in module [7. Terraform Locals](/terraform/7-variables/7b-locals#exercises)
</Callout>

{<h3>Configure</h3>}
Add a `depends_on` to the production activation resource so that the production activation doesn't start until the staging activation has completed.

{<h3>Plan/Apply</h3>}
Run `terraform plan` to confirm your changes. Run `terraform apply` if all looks in order.

{<h3>Commit</h3>}
Commit your change and push it to GitHub. 

Although this is not a real use case it shows how the order of the resources updates/creations can be somewhat controlled.
