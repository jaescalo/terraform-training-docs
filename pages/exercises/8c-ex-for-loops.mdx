<Steps>
{<h3>Configure</h3>}
Create the following variable in your **_variables.tf_**:
```hcl filename="variables.tf" copy
variable "apps" {
  default = [ "www", "api", "blog", "shop", "cdn"]
}
```

{<h3>Update</h3>}
In your **_main.tf_** and with the use of the `for` expression, convert each app name above into a hostname by appending the example.com domain. The new local variable containing the new hostnames list can be named `app_hostnames` and we will use it in later exercises.

{<h3>Output</h3>}
Output the `app_hostnames` local to confirm the logic is applied.

{<h3>Plan</h3>}
Run `terraform plan`. You could run `terraform apply` too, but because we are not modifying any resources no changes will be applied anyway.

{<h3>Commit</h3>}
Commit your change and push it to GitHub.
